  <h1>Beyoncé</h1>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    <strong>Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter</strong> (/biːˈjɒnseɪ/; born September 4, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Born and raised in <a href="#">Houston</a>, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a
    child and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny's Child. Managed by her father,
    <a href="#">Mathew Knowles</a>, the group became one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé's debut album, <em><a href="#">Dangerously in Love</a></em> (2003), which established her as a solo artist
    worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 number-one singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy".

    Kelly Rowland met <a href="#">LaTavia Roberson</a> while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing
    the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not
    good.
